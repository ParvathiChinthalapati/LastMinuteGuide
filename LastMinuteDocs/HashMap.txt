Java Map Interface
A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.
A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.

Java Map Hierarchy
There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap, and three classes: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap. 
A Map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values. HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.
A Map can't be traversed, so you need to convert it into Set using keySet() or entrySet() method.

Map.Entry Interface
Entry is the subinterface of Map. So we will be accessed it by Map.Entry name. It returns a collection-view of the map, whose elements are of this class. It provides methods to get key and value.

Java HashMap class

Java HashMap class implements the map interface by using a hash table. It inherits AbstractMap class and implements Map interface.
Points to remember
Java HashMap class contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap class contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap class may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap class is non synchronized.
Java HashMap class maintains no order.
The initial default capacity of Java HashMap class is 16 with a load factor of 0.75.

Java LinkedHashMap class

Java LinkedHashMap class is Hashtable and Linked list implementation of the Map interface, with predictable iteration order. It inherits HashMap class and implements the Map interface.
Points to remember
Java LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key.
Java LinkedHashMap contains unique elements.
Java LinkedHashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java LinkedHashMap is non synchronized.
Java LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order. 
The initial default capacity of Java HashMap class is 16 with a load factor of 0.75.

Java TreeMap class

Java TreeMap class is a red-black tree based implementation. It provides an efficient means of storing key-value pairs in sorted order. 
The important points about Java TreeMap class are: 
Java TreeMap contains values based on the key. It implements the NavigableMap interface and extends AbstractMap class.
Java TreeMap contains only unique elements.
Java TreeMap cannot have a null key but can have multiple null values.
Java TreeMap is non synchronized.
Java TreeMap maintains ascending order.

What is difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
HashMap
TreeMap
1) HashMap can contain one null key.
TreeMap cannot contain any null key.
2) HashMap maintains no order.
TreeMap maintains ascending order.
